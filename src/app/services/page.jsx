            Some of the teaching techniques we use in Holy Child are ” Read to
            Discover”, Inquiry based teaching & Play based learning. We
            discovered that often primary & secondary school children do not
            read their textbooks. Teachers write notes on the board and that’s
            all the learners read. To help children harness the treasures hidden
            in the well- written textbooks their parents paid for, our teachers
            make pupils read the textbook aloud in the class. In the process,
            the pupils identify the main points and underline them. The main
            ideas are discussed in class . Thereafter the children guided by the
            guideline written on the board makes their notes by themselves.
            These notes are short & easy to be read, In using “Read to Discover
            ” technique to teach capital letters, for instance, children are
            asked to underline capital letters used in story books. As they
            observe that always, every sentence begins with a capital letter and
            place names always start with a capital letter, the lesson sinks
            deeper than when teachers keep telling the pupils when to used
            capital letters.

            Another teaching teachers employ in Holy Child is the inquiry
            teaching technique. We discovered children are often absent-minded.
            So doing all the talking & telling does not give us the results we
            desire. By constantly asking children questions and patiently
            waiting for the answers, we are able to help our children think.Play
            based learning occupies a central place in our nursery classes.
            Twice a week, Pre nursery & Nursery 1 children spend about 2 hours
            on the playground. Teachers prepare the playground. As children
            engage in different activities, they learn how to interact with each
            other. They learn what works and what does not. Teachers never
            disrupt but allow the children to achieve ” flow”. Play learning
            equally plays out when teachers use balls to teach colours or
            counting. Kids are having fun & at the same time learning.

            Differentiated teaching is yet another teaching technique employed
            in Holy Child. Often children in the same class have different
            abilities. Some are quick to understand while others are slow. To
            assist the slow learners without slowing down the high flyers,
            teachers in Holy Child are trained to administer other activities to
            the fast learners. Thus while learner A is attempting her 5
            activity, learner B is on his 2nd activity. Because, we realize that
            every child is unique, teachers are trained not to make the slow
            learners bad. And to encourage each child to have a good self
            esteem, positions are not written on report sheets. Again because we
            realize that present – day Nigerian graduates leave much to be
            desired, the school organizes weekly training on English grammar,
            writing, teaching techniques. Discipline, Early Child Development &
            teacher – parent relationship among others.
